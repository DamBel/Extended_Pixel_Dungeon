# Extended Pixel Dungeon

Welcome to Extended Pixel Dungeon website !

## What is it ?

This is the website which will be used in the future in order to introduce my future mod, "Extended Pixel Dungeon" (looking for a better name :p ), and showcase its features and updates.

Currently in its very first version, the website is not ready and is still in development.

## Tell me more about this project ! 

This mod will mostly concentrate on adding more floors, items, and mechanics, while staying close to the original game, **Pixel Dungeon**, made by **watabou**. 

The development is still waiting to begin, since I'm not that familiar with game development at all ! But little by little, I'm improving in learning how the base game works, and I hope I will start working on it very soon ! :)
